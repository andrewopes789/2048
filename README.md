## Restate - A real estate market analysis application

### Background and Overview

Restate is a general guide for everyone from first-time homebuyers to seasoned real estate investors, to gain a sense of the real estate 
market in the areas they are interested in purchasing a property. 

Users enter an initial zip code for which they would like market information, and then for the selected area, the application will map the 
following analytics versus time:

* Median Price of New Listings
* Median Price of All Listings
* Median Price of All Pending Listings
* Count of New Listings
* Count of Sold Listings
* Median List Price per Square Foot
* Median Sold Price per Square Foot
* Average Sold Price versus List Price Ratio
* Average Days on the Market

### Functionality & MVP

In Restate, users will be able to:

* Select an area to retrieve real estate analytics for
* Select which analytics parameters are mapped on the graph
* Specify the type(s) of property (i.e. single family, condominium, townhouse) to retrieve analytics for
* Specify the timeframe to receive analytics for, segmented by month, dating back to April 2015

In addition, this project will include:

* An About modal describing the basic functionality
